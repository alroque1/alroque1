<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Angela Roque and I am a full-time student at ASU, working part-time to get a degree in GIT (Graphic Information Technology). After I graduate, I plan to find a better job that I can enjoy while putting my skills to use and gaining new knowledge. In terms of coding, I really enjoy it because I get to be involved in the process of creating the final product. </p>
